FilesystemExplorerExt4
======================

This repository is meant to someday host the code for a ext4 filesystem
explorer implemented in JavaScript and HTML5.

As of this writing, however, there's nothing in here but a sample disk
image file in ext4 format and a text document describing how it was built.
See the existing FilesystemExplorerFAT12 repository for a more concrete
example of how this program is eventually meant to work.
